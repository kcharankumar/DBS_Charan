<h1>Information: What is CSS</h1>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users.

A document is a collection of information that is structured using a markup language.</p>
<p class="info">Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a useable form for your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.</p>


<p class="example"> This is the example of text-transform.  You can give uppercase, lowercase and capitalize as the options for this option. </p>
